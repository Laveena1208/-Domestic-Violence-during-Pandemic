            About Domestic Violence
        </h1>

        <div class="welcome">
            <p>
                Domestic violence (also named domestic abuse or family violence) is violence or other abuse in a domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation.In its broadest sense, domestic violence also involves violence against children, teenagers, parents,
                or the elderly. It takes multiple forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive, and sexual abuse, which can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and to violent physical abuse such as choking,
                beating and acid throwing that results in disfigurement or death. In some countries, domestic violence may be seen as justified or legally permitted, particularly in cases of actual or suspected infidelity on the part of the woman.

                The biological effects of violence have become increasingly better understood and include effects on the brain, neuroendocrine system, and immune response. Consequences include increased incidences of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder,
                and suicide; increased risk of cardiovascular disease; and premature mortality. The health consequences of violence vary with the age and sex of the victim as well as the form of violence. People can be the victims of multiple forms of
                violence, and the health effects can be cumulative.

            Process of Charges
        </h1>

        <div class="welcome">
            <p>
                After the accused person has been arrested, an arraignment takes place. This is where allegations are issued and the person on trial issues a plea. After consulting with a criminal defense lawyer, a guilty or not guilty plea is entered. At any point in
                the process, the defendant can decide to change his or her plea from not guilty to guilty. It is best to have a criminal defense lawyer to assist with these proceedings and to use as counsel about what to do at each step. New court dates
                are set after the arraignment, and then the criminal defense lawyer starts taking all necessary steps in defending the accused. Pre-trial negotiations are set on the first date that comes to pass. This is where the hired legal representative
                discusses the case facts, criminal history of the defendant, the victim’s history, any injuries that were sustained and other factors related to the case. Facts of the case may need to be investigated by the lawyer in order to determine
                potential defenses. Witnesses are contacted that understand the relationship of the accused and the victim, those with personal relationships with the defendant, persons who witness the alleged crimes and anyone that may have favorable
                comments about the accused party’s character are all usually interviewed for the defense.
